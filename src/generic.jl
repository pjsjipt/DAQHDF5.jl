# Storing generic stuff
# Often we need to store more complex stuff.
# Julia provides the Serialization module and we use it
# to store unknown stuff.
# We are not responsible for changes in the format
# The user is responsible for including the appropriate packages as needed
# when loading data that have types defined in 3rd party packages.
